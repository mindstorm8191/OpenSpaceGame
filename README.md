### Aspects of Halo that people loved

1.  Powerful, dangerous enemies that were hard to kill. Regular humans didn't stand a chance
2.  Playing a character powerful enough to fight against such an enemy. It was always fun to get crazy kills against other creatures.
3.  Battles were more than being the first to shoot the other. Shielding allowed you to attack then hide. Melee strikes were knock-outs, meaning getting close could eliminate an enemy without costing ammo.
4.  Lots of things happening around you, even during battles. While you're busy winning in one place, you're losing in another. Also, epic events
5.  Vehicles to be driven; all the shenanigans with the Warthog, and how the Scorpion could decimate everything on a battlefield
6.  Co-op play was very fun for friends to play
7.  Discovery of a 2nd enemy, the Flood, that not even the Covenant knows how to contain
8.  Halo 5's ads: It left you with questions that had to be answered in regards to Master Chief
9.  Robust characters, and plenty of them. Every character has a story arc and own personality
10. The main character isn't just a super powerful creation, but a part of a robust world
11. Battleground-based maps, which go to give advantage to one party or the other; usually the enemy, as you are trying to overtake them.

### Aspects to focus on for this game

-   Continuous action. Have enemy enforcements arrive during your ongoing battles, brought in by drop ships or APC style ground vehicles. Have enemies stop fighting for a moment to take notice of these things.
-   Serious losses on the human side during the whole campaign. The main player doesn't have to live through this - we could end it in a mystery as to whether they survived or not (it'll be even better when they come back). Lots of elite soldiers die along the way, too.
-   Enemy commanders giving orders to their troops. Battles that include commanders will be harder, since enemies will cooperate with each other more. Killing a commander will leave them in chaos; weaker troops will freak out, everyone will fall back to better shelter
-   Lots of enemy types. Halo's Covenant only really had 3 types: Grunts, Jackals and Elites. You didn't see more types until later games. We should strive for 4 or 5. They don't all have to work together all the time; maybe have two major groups that basically run independently
-   Limited player armament. Halo allowed only two weapons to be carried at a time; it could be anything, though. I think we could stick with 1 small, 1 medium & 1 large weapon.
-   Effective melee kills - and ways to block them. Melee kills won't work against all alien units
-   Lots of vehicles. Allow the player to man (some) alien vehicles too
-   Arena style levels everywhere. Some of the scientists notice this on the new ship, but don't know why it's that way
-   Vehicle battles, both on the ground and in the air. Give humans a flying attack craft that players can man. Allow them to man gun points on dropships
-   Multiple grenade types or effects.
    -   Sticky bombs were very enjoyed in Halo, but normal grenades were effective too. Maybe we could have a throwable cable weapon, that will wrap around an enemy and detonate after a time.
    -   Include a firebomb grenade, that spreads napalm across a swath of land. It can also choke out a vehicle's enging, leaving it stuck for a time & require restarting when the fire dies out
-   Include more throwable weapons and effects, too... but I don't know what.

### Story Line (plan so far)

Humans are in a losing war with a multi-species alien alliance, who are working to eradicate humans from the galaxy. During that time, the human forces encounter a ship from an unknown alien species, hidden within an asteroid cluster. As they are investigating it, the alien alliance finds the ship too. You are sent in to defend the humans on the alien ship, so they can continue investigating.

Along the way, the alien alliance explores the ship faster than the humans can, and a new alien species is discovered, still on it, and begin devastating the alliance forces. The ship everyone is on comes alive, shifting into a new form, and destroys all the ships surrounding it.

Now, you & your team are stuck on the ship, while the new alien reclaims control of it, killing both humans and allies as it goes. Your team is the only ones that are strong enough to face them...

### Other decisions

-   Offer non-vocal communication methods. Players can point at something to tell your team to do something with it. Point at an enemy & tell your team to attack, ignore them, or stay out of their view. This system should be robust enough to give specific orders to teammates (unlike what they had in Halo 5)
-   Allow 4-player split screen campaign mode. Let players use all 4 team members to do battle against the enemy. Increase the enemy count based on the number of players, and scale this faster on higher difficulties. 4-player coop can also be played online with strangers
-   Have smart party-building on game match-making. Players are grouped based both on skill level and level of communication. For example, mic users will group together based on how much they use it. Players that use non-vocal communication frequently will be grouped separately from those that rarely use it, or don't use it at all.
-   Player will be on a four man team. Members of that team will die through the story. They will be replaced when possible, such as returning to headquarters or combining two partial groups. We might have only 2 or 3 4-man teams engaged on this mission
-   Player will begin the mission with personal weapons, but need to switch to other weapons after a time.
-   Plan to release this on Steam. It may have to be released on chapters, maybe $5 each. With 12 episodes (or maps) that's $60 for the full game.
-   Offer a special deathmatch game mode: Long Shot. You get a better score for killing people at greater ranges.
-   Another deathmath game mode: Stampede. Each kill increases your scoring multiplier until you die
